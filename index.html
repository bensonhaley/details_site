<h2>defining this project</h2>
<p>In the digital age, many of us move through online spaces and print spaces differently. We’ve learned them in different contexts, and their interfaces still just feel fundamentally different. This is not to say we might not use an online article and a print article for the same purpose, just that we simply can’t seem to get over that physical, psychological difference we “feel.”</p>

<p>Consequently, we often forget to look for the continuity between these two spaces. The web space and mobile space are here, and will likely be our dominant “spaces” from here on out. And the technology that has allowed us to reach this point has been so revolutionary, and so new—it’s difficult to see print and web as the same.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to set a reminder. Computer technology and the web may have been created by technical geniuses, but someone eventually realized that they needed to be designed for humans, humans with a history of interactions with tools and with writing. It’s unfair to leave the print tradition out of the conversation when we’re looking at humans’ relationship with computer and web technology. Expanded interactivity and multimodality will continue to claim more space, but the web has both grown out of and continues to be shaped by print and its history. To competently navigate digital spaces, we should be aware of how they both reflect and extend the printed space.

<h2><a name="intro">HTML’s <i>details</i> element (and <i>summary</i> element)</a></h2>
<p>The focus of this project is a small but significant and interesting piece of technology, a snippet of markup that interacts with software then hardware to build a feature of the digital space discussed above. This particular markup represents a visual output that (this project would argue) is grounded in print but also extends into new, very “web” territory.</p>

<p>The W3C’s HTML 5.3 documentation defines the details element as “a disclosure widget from which the user can obtain additional information or controls.”</p>

<p>The details element is categorize as an interactive element, and so falls under the HTML category of interactive content, which is “content that is specifically intended for user interaction.” (3.2.4.2.7. W3C Specs)</p>

<p>The details element allows a viewer to click on a piece of text in order to “open” or reveal an additional section of text.

<h2><a name="java"><i>details</i> tag and Javascript</a></h2>
<p>The details and summary elements are especially important to consider when discussing HTML’s development because they create a function that used to require a Javascript to be accomplished. </p>


<h2><a name="browser">browser support</a></h2>

<h2><a name="print"><i>details</i> and print: parallels and differences</a></h2>
<p>It’s important to first look to the ways in which HTML’s details element can be connected to the printed page and the print tradition. The printed word is populated with many text “structures” that match that of the summary/details element. These structures include a sequence and visual hierarchy that interact to create the semantic meaning of the structure: the first section of text, shorter in length and perhaps bolded, features the “broader” component, while the following section, situated below and often longer in length, set apart by indentation or a smaller point size, offers elaboration on the component it follows.</p>

<p>When we see this structure, we intuitively recognize the relationship between these two components. It’s entirely ubiquitous within the realm of the printed page.</p>

There are ways that the details element can be seen as more tailored to a web environment than other HTML elements&mdash;as diverging from the print tradition more significantly. The details tag creates a text element, but the interactivity that results is something that we do no necessarily see within the print tradition.
